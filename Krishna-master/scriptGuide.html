<h1>Interview Guide</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Thank you for participating in this interview. As explained earlier, I am really interested in understanding how Blood Banks work. So, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me. 

        In this interview, I want to focus on your experience with Blood banks so far, of course, there are no right or wrong answers. It also means you are more than welcome to tell us if there is something that needs to be improved. 
        
        The interview should take no more than an hour, depending on how much we talk. And just to get the formalities out of the way, I want to tell you that this interview is voluntary and that you can opt-out at any time for any reason. I also want to tell you that everything you say is anonymized; so if I share some quotes from the interview with my colleagues, they will not know who said them. 
        
        Finally, I want to ask if I can record the audio from our interview? I’m not going to share the recording with anyone. It’s just that it will help me to focus on what you are saying if I don’t have to take all my notes while we are talking. You have my guarantee that I will delete the recording when I am done taking notes.
        
        Thank You.</p>
